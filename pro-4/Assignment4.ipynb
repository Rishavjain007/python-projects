        "The SDLC is essential for structured software development, enhancing project management, and ensuring quality outcomes. By following these phases, organizations can effectively manage the complexities of software development, leading to successful project completion.\n",
        "\n",
        " Here’s an overview of each phase:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Planning:\n",
        "\n",
        "This initial stage involves defining the project’s goals, scope, resources, and timelines. Stakeholders identify the needs and requirements, and feasibility studies assess potential risks and challenges. A project plan is created to guide the development process.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Requirements Gathering and Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this phase, detailed requirements are gathered through interviews, surveys, and analysis of existing systems. Requirements are categorized into functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system performs). This leads to the creation of a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Design:\n",
        "\n",
        "The design phase translates requirements into a blueprint for the software. This involves architectural design (overall structure) and detailed design (specific components). Tools like UML diagrams may be used. The goal is to create a comprehensive design document that guides developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Development:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This is often the longest phase of the SDLC. Coding standards and best practices are followed to ensure quality. Version control systems are typically used to manage code changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Testing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Testing is crucial to ensure that the software meets all requirements and is free of defects. Various types of testing are performed, including unit testing (individual components), integration testing (combined components), system testing (entire system), and user acceptance testing (UAT). Issues found are reported and fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Deployment:\n",
        "\n",
        "Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to the production environment. This may involve installation, configuration, and data migration. Depending on the organization, deployment can be done all at once (big bang) or in stages (phased rollout).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Maintenance:\n",
        "\n",
        "After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves ongoing support, bug fixes, updates, and enhancements based on user feedback. Maintenance ensures that the software continues to meet user needs and adapts to changing environments."

Objects represent real-world entities and can contain both data and methods.OOP enhances software development through its principles, enabling developers to create more organized, maintainable, and scalable code. \n",

        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation:\n",
        " It binds data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on given data into a single unit or class. This helps protect the internal state of an object from unintended interference and misuse.\n",

        "Example,\n",

        " \n",
        "2. Inheritance:\n",
        "It allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",

        "3. Polymorphism:\n",
        "It allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.\n",
        "This can be achieved through method overriding (as seen in the speak method of the Dog and Cat classes) or method overloading (same method name with different parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Abstraction:\n",
